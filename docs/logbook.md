# What I've Been Working On

| Date | Hours | What I Did |
| :---: | :---: | --- |
| 5/24 | 3.5 | - Sifted through the files of the old webscraper tool to better understand what I am doing. <br> - Looked through lots of information regarding the NASS/CDS database to figure out a better way to collect the data. <br> - Did some research on what the best tool would be for this project. Settled on the PyQt6 framework for Python. <br> - Created this GitHub repo. | 
| 5/25 | 1.5 | - Researching the best way to put this program into the hands of those who don't know how to code. Figure that it might just be easiest to make users install Python and run it themselves (they will also need to install all of the libraries). Will continue to do research on this front... |
| 5/26 | 6 | - More research on how the NHTSA formats and organizes their data in the NASS/CDS datasets. For now, I think it's easiest to gather the data the way it's done in the old app. Later on, I might look at utilizing the NHTSA's FTP site to download the NASS/CDS data directly, but parsing all of these years of data into something useful will be a nightmare since some years had different organization schemes than others. Notably, year ranges 1979-1987, 1988-1996, 1997-2008, and 2009-2015 are quite different from each other in terms of how the data is organized. However, a positive to doing it the FTP way is that it only has to be downloaded and parsed once, since the NASS/CDS database is no longer updated (replaced in 2016 by CISS, which *also* uses a different organization scheme). This would enable the user to query the data in a fraction of the time it takes to do so when it's contained in an online database. <br> - Started thinking about how the GUI will look and put together a small test run to figure out how PyQt6 functions. <br> - Started on a software development plan, completed the requirements gathering phase (for now). |
| 5/31 | 4 | - Dug into the HTML and Javascript for the NASS/CDS Crash Viewer to see what can be done to gather the data more easily. I think I figured out a better way to query the database without having to use Selenium! <br> - Re-formatted/organized the software development plan documents and created some new ones that may be needed later on. <br> - Updated all documentation to make navigation easier. |
| 6/1 | 3 | - Browsed over the old application to catch more of the requirements for the project. I assume that what functionality is there should still be present in the new app. <br> - Updated the requirements specification document to better reflect what is needed. Functional and non-functional requirements are now separate and much more detailed. <br> - Created example documents from the old project (scatterplot and CSV) that should be used as a guide for the new project. <br> - Started on system design |
| 6/9 | 4 | - Completed system design and corresponding data flow chart. I now have a *much* better understanding of how everything needs to be laid out in the final product, so things will be much easier from here. <br> - Spent some time creating a small program to see if it's actually worth it to parallelize requests as opposed to just doing them sequentially (it is **definitely** worth it... 5-10x speedups). Demo code is [`here`](../demos/parallel_req.py). <br> - Sent an email to the NHTSA support desk inquiring on rate limits for the CrashViewer database. <br> - Started on user interface design. I figure that this part doesn't matter too much since we just need a fast, working product. |
| 6/10 | 3 | - Laid all the groundwork for user interface design. There are still some elements that need to be a little more fleshed out (for example, I'm still not exactly sure how the data viewer should look), but I think I am 95% of the way there. <br> - Moving on to database designing. This shouldn't take too long. |
| 6/13 | 4.5 | - Got a relatively vague email back from the NHTSA regarding rate limits, so I sent another, more detailed inquiry. <br> - Did some research on SQLite and databasing in general. Created a small demo program to see if SQLite3 will actually be a good option for the project. Demo code is [`here`](../demos/sqlite_db.py). It's actually pretty simple to use, so I think I'll go with it. <br> - Coming up with a good database design was harder than I thought, but it's finished and now I can finally start on implementation! |
| 6/14 | 8.5 | - Created the general layout for the main window, logs window, and saving window in the PyQt6 designer. This program definitely has a bit of a steep learning curve but I'm getting better at it. <br> - Set up all slots/signals so that each page can be accessed via buttons. <br> - Refactored `MainWindow.ui` to separate `.ui` files and restructured the project files to be more consistent. |
| 6/15 | N/A | N/A |
