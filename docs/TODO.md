# To-Do

Sorted from highest (top) to lowest priority:

- ENHANCE: Option to download PDF or CDRX file
    - Optionally, include EDR information in separate tab, based on event clicked
- ENHANCE: Multi-analysis
- ENHANCE: Include link for each case
- FIX: All button logic (setText, enable/disable, etc.) in events tab, as it's very messy at the moment
- FIX: Error that results from scraping images without a case selected
    - Could be fixed by:
        - Autoselect first case in list if nothing is selected
        - Block buttons until case is selected
- FIX: empty fields in the data viewer summary tab
- ENHANCE: Add proper app icon
