# To-Do

- ENHANCE: Add EDR information to case page
    - Either as fields or downloadable file
    - If downloadable, download pdf. If pdf not available, download cdrx.
    - Unfortunately, I will not be able to view the cdrx files, as they require a subscription to an expensive paid software service. So, my ability to do anything with those files ends there.
- FIX: Error that results from scraping images without a case selected
    - Could be fixed by:
        - Autoselect first case in list if nothing is selected
        - Block buttons until case is selected
- FIX: empty fields in the data viewer summary tab
- ENHANCE: Include link for each case
- ENHANCE: Add proper app icon
