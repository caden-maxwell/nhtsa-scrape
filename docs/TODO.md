# To-Do

Sorted from highest (top) to lowest priority:

- FIX: Unused max request time after refactoring the RequestHandler
- FIX: Remove messageboxes for individual events, too obtrusive
- ENHANCE: Replace those^ messageboxes with messages at bottom of screen so the user knows something actually happened
- ENHANCE: Include link for each case
- FIX: Logic for profile naming/renaming (weird behavior, maybe just remove renaming from multi-analysis)
