# To-Do

Sorted from highest (top) to lowest priority:

- FIX: Add params to summary tab instead of just "?"
- FIX: Come up with better naming for profiles
- FIX: Remove messageboxes for individual events, too obtrusive
- FIX: Photo "saved" dialog doesn't reset
- ENHANCE: Replace those^ messageboxes with messages at bottom of screen so the user knows something actually happened
- ENHANCE: Include link for each case
- ENHANCE: Add "Open" to settings to go straight to data folder
- FIX: Put computationally intensive things on another thread
    - Scatterplot tab:
        - Linear regression
        - Scatterplot itself
    - Database functions
    - Saving photos to file (completely blocks GUI as of right now)
