# To-Do

Sorted from highest (top) to lowest priority:

- ENHANCE: Include link for each case
- FIX: Error that results from scraping images without a case selected
- FIX: Get rid of summary tab or make it more useful
- ENHANCE: Add "Open file location" button to open a profile's file location in the file explorer
- ENHANCE: Add a "Save to..." option in the settings menu to save the data to somewhere other than the default location
- FIX: All button logic (setText, enable/disable, etc.) in events tab, as it's very messy at the moment
- ENHANCE: Add proper app icon
