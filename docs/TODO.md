# To-Do

Sorted from highest (top) to lowest priority:

- FIX: Unused max request time after refactoring the RequestHandler
- FIX: Remove messageboxes for individual events, too obtrusive
- FIX: Photo save is blocking on GUI
- FIX: Photo "saved" dialog doesn't reset
- ENHANCE: Replace those^ messageboxes with messages at bottom of screen so the user knows something actually happened
- ENHANCE: Include link for each case
- ENHANCE: Add "Open" to settings to go straight to data folder
