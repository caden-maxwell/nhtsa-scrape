# Software Development Plan

## Testing & Debugging

*   A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    *   Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    *   For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
*   Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience.
