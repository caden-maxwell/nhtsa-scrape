# Project Proposal

## Project Overview

- **Project Title:** [Your project title]
- **Project Description:** A GUI application that aims to improve upon the limited functionality of the NASS/CDS [crash viewer](https://crashviewer.nhtsa.dot.gov/LegacyCDS/Search), and overall make the process of researching automobile crash data much easier and more efficient.
- **Project Duration:** 60-70 hours - Estimated completion on June 20, 2023
- **Project Team:** [Caden Maxwell](https://www.github.com/caden-maxwell)

## Objectives

- Allow the user to compare their own data and images with those from the NHTSA.
- Allow the user to easily save data and images to their local machine for further research.
- Reduce the need to interact with the NHTSA's crash viewer, which is slow and limited in functionality.

## Scope

This software will be used to fetch data and images from the NASS/CDS 
database, which is made accesible through the NHTSA. The software will 
present the data in a GUI application, in such a way as to facilitate 
research and allow the user to investigate numerous cases at once. The 
user may compare this information with their own, which may be useful 
for consulting firms hired to investigate an accident. The 
user will be able to easily filter out cases that are not of interest, 
and save both data and images to their local machine for further research. 
A CSV file will be created at the user's request, containing the data 
for all cases that are currently of interest. This CSV file will be 
formatted in such a way as to be easily imported into a spreadsheet 
program, such as Microsoft Excel. The user will also be able to make 
separate research profiles, allowing them to return to their current 
research at a later time. Multiple profiles can be saved, allowing the 
user to easily switch between different cases of interest. 

## Deliverables

The software will be available as a standalone executable for Windows and MacOS. The source code and an installation guide will also be available for download on GitHub, allowing the user to run the software on any platform that supports Python, PyQt6, and any other project dependencies. Documentation will be provided in the form of a user manual, which will be available as a PDF file. All planning and development documentation will be available in Markdown format.
