| 5/24 | 3.5 | - Sifted through the files of the old webscraper tool to better understand what I am doing. <br> - Looked through lots of information regarding the NASS/CDS database to figure out a better way to collect the data. <br> - Did some research on what the best tool would be for this project. Settled on the PyQt6 framework for Python. <br> - Created this GitHub repo. |
