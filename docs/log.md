| Date | Hours | What I Did |

| 5/24 | 3.5 | - Sifted through the files of the old webscraper tool to better understand what I am doing. <br> - Looked through lots of information regarding the NASS/CDS database to figure out a better way to collect the data. <br> - Did some research on what the best tool would be for this project. Settled on the PyQt6 framework for Python. <br> - Created this GitHub repo. | 
| 5/25 | 1.5 | - Researching the best way to put this program into the hands of those who don't know how to code. Figure that it might just be easiest to make users install Python and run it themselves. Will continue to research on this front... |
