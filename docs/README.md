This directory serves as a central hub for all the important notes, diagrams, logs, and other resources that will help you understand and navigate the project.

## Contents

- [To-Do](TODO.md): A list of things that need to get done. Bug fixes, feature enhancements, etc.
- [Installation Guide](installation.md): Get started with the installation instructions for setting up the application on your local machine.
- [User Documentation](user-docs.md): Access user-friendly documentation that provides guidance on how to use and interact with the software.
